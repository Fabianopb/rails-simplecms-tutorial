This app was created during the <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html" target="_blank">"Ruby on Rails 4 Essential Training"</a> course from Kevin Skoglund at Lynda.com.

It covers:
- the structure of the framework: MVC architecture, DRY code, flexibility and modularity.
- Setting up the whole environment (doing that in Windows is horrible, I decided to use Cloud9 later - which uses Ubuntu). Also it uses MySQL that I switched to PostgreSQL because is the default database used by Heroku.
- creating new projects, controllers, models and views
- creating databases and migrations
- defining the CRUD commands
- layouts, use of helpers and partials
- use of forms, validation methods and avoiding cross-site requests
- user authentication and public vs restricted areas
- nesting controllers
- representational state transfer
- debugging
